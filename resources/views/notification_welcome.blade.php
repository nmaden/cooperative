    Welcome to Kazakhstan!
    <br>
    Dear {{ $name }} {{ $surname }}, <br>
    According to the current law “On population migration”, every immigrant temporarily staying in Kazakhstan for more than five calendar days from the date of crossing the state border is required to have a temporary residence permit - registration.
    “Red Village” hotel, as the host party, informs you of the successful obtaining of temporary registration for the period of your reservation; the regional migration police department will be notified of your arrival and departure.
    We remind you that according to the current rules, when changing the temporary place of residence, foreign quests are obliged to notify the migration police about the change of address within 3 days.
    We wish you a pleasant and eventful vacation!
